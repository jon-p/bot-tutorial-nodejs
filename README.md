## Configure your local BOT_ID environment variable

Open the file `.env` from your local files in your text editor of choice.
Find where it says "YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE" and replace it with the ID of your new bot.

If you don't know what your Bot ID is, please refer back to [this](#get-bot-id) section,
where it is explained how to retrieve it.

If your Bot ID is 12345678910, then:

    BOT_ID="YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"

becomes:

    BOT_ID="12345678910"

## Start the server
